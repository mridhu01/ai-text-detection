# Ai-text-detection
A compact project that detects AI-generated text using four different models: an ensemble detector, a machine-learning classifier, a perplexity-based model, and a statistical rule-based detector. Includes training code, evaluation, and inference scripts to compare how each approach performs on the same dataset.
